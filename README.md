What is MPY Blockly?
MPY Blockly is a free visual programming tools for Micropython on ESP32.By stacking coloured blocks on top of each other a control program can be rapidly generated.

This simple click’n’drag programming method allows you to rapidly develop control sequences for real life microcontroller projects. This programming method is very similar to Scratch 3.

MPY Blockly also supports standard ‘text’ programming for those who prefer to use a text editor for programming.

MicroPython
MicroPython is a lean and efficient implementation of the Python 3 programming language that includes a small subset of the Python standard library and is optimised to run on microcontrollers and in constrained environments.

ESP32
A feature-rich MCU with integrated Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity for a wide-range of applications


Why MPY Blockly?
For beginners, use MPY Blockly to get started quickly. Even without any programming or hardware foundation. Kids and teens can also start learning programming with MPY Blockly.
For programmers who are inexperienced in hardware, MPY Blockly can quickly drive a series of common hardware modules such as microcontrollers, various sensors, various motors, buttons, audio equipment, monochrome and color displays, RGB strips, etc.
Even for professionals, MPY Blockly integrates various hardware drivers (all tested in detail) and various Internet communication protocols, which can greatly reduce the development workload.
